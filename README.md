# PDF-Receipt-Sorter
A quick receipt sorter that sorts using information provided from receipts and pushes the sorted information to an excel sheet. Uses python for all processes.

Isn't meant for professional use as it is only programmed to sort my mother's receipts form CIBC. It was meant for a quick project and to
see if I could help ease her workload. I will finish the final product later.
